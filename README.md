# Vendor Management System with Performance Metrics

This repository contains the Django backend for Vendor Management System with Performance Metrics, which includes a comprehensive Vendor Management System. Below you will find instructions to navigate the documentation and set up the project locally.

## Quick Start

Before diving into the detailed documentation, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Clone the repository using:

```bash



git  clone  https://github.com/Shashank9928/VendorManagementSystem.git



cd  VendorManagementSystem



```

## Documentation

The documentation is split into two main parts:

1.  **Setup Documentation**: Detailed instructions for setting up the application locally can be found in the [SETUP_DOCS](./SETUP_DOCS.md). This includes instructions on environment setup, dependencies, and database configurations.

2.  **API Documentation**: Comprehensive details about the API endpoints, including how to authenticate and use the APIs, are available in the [API_DOCS](./API_DOCS.md). This section is essential for developers looking to integrate or interact with the API.

## Features

Briefly list the key features of the application:

- Vendor Profile Management

- Purchase Order Tracking

- Performance Metrics Analysis

# Application Setup

To provide comprehensive documentation on setting up Django application, running it, and executing test cases, follow the structured guide below. This documentation will cover initial repository setup, environment configuration, dependency installation, application startup, and how to run tests.

### Setting Up the Repository and Environment

#### 1. Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using git. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash



git  clone  https://github.com/Shashank9928/VendorManagementSystem.git



cd  VendorManagementSystem



```

#### 2. Setting Up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies separately from your global Python installation. If you haven't installed `virtualenv` yet, you can install it using pip:

```bash



pip  install  virtualenv



```

Create a new virtual environment in the project directory:

```bash



python  -m  venv  ve



```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

```bash



.\ve\Scripts\activate



```

- On macOS and Linux:

```bash



source  ve/bin/activate



```

#### 3. Installing Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies:

```bash



pip  install  -r  requirements.txt



```

### Configuring the Application

#### 1. Setting Up the Database

If your Django project uses a database that requires initial setup (like PostgreSQL or MySQL), configure it accordingly. For SQLite (the default), no additional setup is required.

#### 2. Migrations

Run the following commands to perform database migrations:

```bash



python  manage.py  makemigrations



python  manage.py  migrate



```

#### 3. Creating a Superuser

To access the Django admin panel and authenticate API requests, create a superuser:

```bash



python  manage.py  createsuperuser



```

Follow the prompts to set the username, email, and password.

### Running the Application

Start the Django development server with the following command:

```bash



python  manage.py  runserver



```

The server will start, typically accessible via `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### Running Test Cases

To ensure the application works as expected, you should run your test suite:

```bash



python  manage.py  test



```

This command will execute all tests defined in your application and provide a summary of the results.

### Accessing the Admin Panel

You can access the Django admin panel by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` in your web browser. Log in using the superuser credentials you created earlier to manage your applicationâ€™s data.

**Default Server Url**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

# API-DOCUMENTATION

## Authentication

### Overview

All API requests, with the exception of the login endpoint, require authentication. Our system utilizes token-based authentication to secure access and ensure that operations are performed by authenticated users.

### Creating a Superuser

Before authenticating, you must have a superuser account. If you haven't already set up a superuser, you can create one using the following command:

bash: `python manage.py createsuperuser`

Follow the prompts to set the username, email, and password for the superuser.

### Using a Pre-configured Superuser

If you are using the provided database (`db.sqlite3` from this repository), a superuser with the following credentials is already set up:

- **Username:** vendor

- **Password:** 1234

You can use these credentials to test and interact with the API without setting up a new superuser.

Include the token in the HTTP header as follows:

`Authorization: Token <YOUR_TOKEN>`

Replace `<YOUR_TOKEN>` with the token you received from the login response.
